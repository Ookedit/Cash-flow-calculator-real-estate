# Cash-flow-calculator-real-estate
Created this calculator because i got pissed at this other facebook post advertising a property at insanely ridiculous prices. The moment i saw the price i calculated if the property meet the 1% rule, guess what it was offset 2x. If in all that property was valuated and that was the result, then something is surely broken in the valuation system in Botswana.
As i mentioned this led me to create this calculator to sort of help calculate the 1% rule as well as cashflow.
